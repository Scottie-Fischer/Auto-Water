Hi, this is a small personal project I made for my bonsai garden. It utilizes a moisture sensor and dispenses water using a brushless motor.
I setup the pi pico to sleep until an interrupt signal from the moisture sensors. On interruption I used a function that looked for false positives from the sensor, then on pure positives it run the motor by activating a GPIO pin that is connected to the base of the transistor. The motor runs for minimum of 2 seconds or runs until the sensor deems there is enough moisture. The pi pico then returns to sleep.
